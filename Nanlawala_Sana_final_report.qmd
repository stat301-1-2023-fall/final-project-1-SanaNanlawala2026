# [Introduction]{.underline}

This report will conduct on exploratory data analysis on a study called
the [LSAC National Longitudinal Bar Passage
Study](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED469370) completed in 1998 by Linda
Wightman. This study focuses on 22,407 students who entered law school
in fall of 1991.

The motivation for this analysis was to explore not only the
demographics of law students entering law school in 1991, but to also
understand how these demographics have changed over the past two
decades. Law school is a large commitment, financially and otherwise,
and understanding how entrance into law school is important context when
examining higher education in America and the limitation of these
opportunities for certain students because of their background. While
personal identification-related variables such as race and gender will
be examined, other things that have a direct relation to law school
applications like LSAT scores and undergraduate GPAs will also be
compared and measured.

# [Data Overview]{.underline}

This dataset contains 22,407 observations with 12 variables that are
most significant in describing the students entering law school in 1991.
Reference the *codebook* for a better understanding of these variables.
6 of these variables are categorical and 6 are numerical variables.
These variables have been specifically chosen from the original, raw,
data collection after a series of decisions made to best encapsulate the
purpose of this data collection and what it was researching.

The variables gender, full-time, family income, law school tier, race,
and birth year have some NA values that will not be included in their
specific univariate and multivariate analyses, but should not have a
significant impact on the final analysis. Some data collection issues
that arose in building this report was the method in collecting data on
the law school tier for each student. This was resolved by doing further
research on the author of the original dataset/study to see with what
criteria the five tiers were constructed.

# [Data Exploration]{.underline}

To begin the exploration of this dataset, understanding the demographics
of the students in 1991 entering law school was most important to gain
any insight or conclusions in the changes in student population today.

An often overlooked demographic variable is age, and in the context of
this dataset, the age of students when entering law school (i.e. how old
they are in 1991)

### Age:

The original dataset recorded the birth year of each student. To enhance
clarity, the collected data was transformed into the age of each student
in 1991. Therefore, the reported ages represent the students' ages as of
the year 1991. It's important to note that these ages may not precisely
reflect their ages at the commencement of law school in the fall of
1991, as specific birth dates (days and months) were not provided.

Below is a histogram showing the distribution of law school entrants
ages in 1991.

![](plots/age_distribution.png)

The left-skew of this chart makes most sense because it is required for
law school students to have received an undergraduate degree before
entering law school in most states. Most college students are near the
age of 18 when entering and 21-22 when leaving, which shows the majority
of students entering law school after graduating college. However there
are a few outliers with people as old as 80 years entering law school.
For the sake of clarity, the few outliers of law school entrants over
the age were filtered out from this chart.

### Race:

This dataset separates race into five categories: Asian, Black,
Hispanic, White, and Other. Before examining the distribution of race
against any other variable in this dataset, it is important to first get
an understanding of this pool of law school entrants in 1991. Below is a
distribution of race among 22,391 students. (information on race was
missing for 16 students)

![](plots/race_distribution.png)

There is a large disparity between the number of white students versus
students of any other race for first year law school students in 1991.
This, unsurprisingly, has changed in the present day. According to the
[Law School Admissions Council
(LSAC)](https://www.lsac.org/blog/incoming-class-2022-major-advance-diversity-more-work-to-do),
the incoming class of 2022 had 36.6% identify as students of color. More
specifically, 7.8% identify as black, 9.4% as Hispanic, and 8.9%
identify as Asian. While this information may not be the best form of
comparison to this dataset (as the LSAC also considers multi-racial as a
separate category and has other forms of identifications). There has
been a larger growth in diversity over the past three decades. Below is
a more clearer comparison of the two years.

| Race     | 1991   | 2022  |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Asian    | 4.01%  | 8.9%  |
| Black    | 6%     | 7.8%  |
| Hispanic | 4.59%  | 9.4%  |
| White    | 83.59% | 57.7% |
| Other    | 1.81   | 16.2% |

#### *Race and Family Income:*

This dataset separates the family income variable into five factors,
1-5, with 1 being the lowest family income range and 5 being the
highest. While specific ranges of income are not specified, having five
ordered factors are helpful in comparing. After examining the large
disparities in racial identity of the law school students in 1991,
examining the intersectionality between race and income seems like a
necessary step in recreating the narrative of law school entrants in
1991.

![](plots/race_fam_inc_distribution.png) Of all Asian and white law
school entrants, most belonged to the 4th family income level. Of the
black, hispanic, and other racially-identifying students, the majority
belonged to the 3rd family income level.

### Family Income:

As mentioned previously, family income was separated into five
categories, numbered 1-5, with 1 being the lowest family income range.
Below is a table showing the distribution of family income among the law
school entrants in 1991.

![](plots/fam_inc_distribution.png)

As shown in the plot, most students belonged in the 4th family income
range. Law school is a big financial decision as well as any other kind
of decision so family income levels may influence this decision.
However, it is unknown which applicants had their family supporting them
financially for law school, but the sentiment remains that there maybe
some influence one's family income has in making the decision to go to
law school.

#### *Fulltime Status and Family Income:*

When exploring the the fulltime or parttime status of students against
their family income, which currently is the only variable that gives any
financial identification of the student, the expectation was that
students were more likely to be parttime if they were of a lower income
status, for reasons such as to hold down jobs, etc. However the plot
below shows a different conclusion. ![](plots/fulltime_fam_inc.png)

There was no conclusive trend found in the proportion of fulltime and
parttime students based on family income ranges. However, this does
highlight law school as a large undertaking, one that probably many
students intend to give their full focus to. Financial aid opportunities
may also influence the decision to be fulltime vs. parttime.

### Law School Tier:

Law school tier ranked from 1-6 (6 being the highest) was established by
clusers 1-6 according to undergraduate GPAS and LSAT scores. Below shows
the general distribution of applicants and their law school.

![](plots/law_tier_distribution.png) Most students attended schools that
were ranked either 3 or 4, with the lowest number of students attending
schools ranked 1.

#### *Family Income and Law School Tier:*

Another interesting exploration was to compare family income ranges with
the law school tiers that the students attended. (again, the law schools
were ranked by and undefined analysis of undergraduate GPA and LSAT
scores)

![](plots/fam_inc_tier_distribution.png) While the law school tiers
directly reference the scores and GPAs, it is a general conclusion that
more prestigious universities accept students with higher LSAT scores
and GPAs, meaning they would rank higher on the list. By family income,
the most students who attended law schools ranked 6 were of the fifth
family income range while the most students who attended law schools
ranked 1 were of the first family income range.

### Law School Graduation Status:

Naturally, not all students who entered law school in 1991 graduated law
school. In fact, below shows the total count of students who did and did
not graduate.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
clean |> 
  drop_na(grad) |> 
  group_by(grad) |> 
  summarize(
    count = n()
  ) |> 
  kable()

```

#### *Graduation Status and Bar Exam Status:*

This dataset shows students who at least attempted law school meaning it
shows students who entered law school in fall of 1991. As it is seen
earlier, there are students who did not graduate law school. However,
below shows a figure that highlights an interesting conclusion about
some students who did not graduate law school.

Below shows the distribution:

![](plots/grad_bar_distribution.png)

This may be surprising to some, to see a small amount of students who
had not graduated and attempted the bar exam, of which 65 passed! This
is because there are some states that require some amount of law school
(as in, not the full three years). These states are New York, Maine, and
West Virginia. The 65 students who passed the bar and the 24 students
who didn't pass the bar (both groups not graduating law school), must
have tried for their bar exam in any of these states.

There are also states that do not require ANY law school to attempt the
bar exam which are California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.
However this dataset are all observations of students who entered law
school in 1991 so it is not applicable (unless the student immediately
dropped out, but that information is not available)

### Bar Exam Attempts:

For those did pass the bar exam, data was collected on when they passed
the bar (as in, which attempt did they pass). This data can be seen in
the table below:

```{r, echo= FALSE}
clean |> 
  group_by(bar_passed_attempt) |> 
  summarise(n = n()) |> 
  kable()
```

#### *LSAT Scores and Bar Exam Attempt*

![](plots/lsat_bar_attempt.png) More people with a higher LSAT score
passed the bar exam on their first try. And those who did not pass the
bar consisted of people with a lower LSAT score.

### Undergraduate GPA:

As always, the GPA scale in 1991 ran on a 4 point scale. It was
interesting point of exploration to see how the undergraduate GPAs of
1991 of law school students compare to law school students today.

![](plots/ugpa_distribution.png)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
clean |> 
  summarise(
    "Median UGPA" = median(ugpa),
    "Highest UGPA" = max(ugpa),
    "Lowest UGPA" = min(ugpa)) |> 
  kable()
```

The median undergraduate GPA for students entering law school in 1991
was 3.2. This number, unsurprisingly is less than the median GPAs in
recent years. According to [U.S.
News,](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/applying/articles/what-is-a-good-college-gpa-for-a-law-school-applicant#:~:text=Among%20the%20191%20ranked%20law,GPA%20is%20much%20higher%20%E2%80%93%203.86.)
the median GPA for law school students entering in 2021 was 3.55.

#### *Undergraduate GPA and Bar Exam Attempt*

Following the distribution of undergraduate GPAs it felt necessary to
compare it to bar exam passes, specificaly the attempts at passing the
bar exam.

![](plots/ugpa_bar_attempt.png) The results are similar to that of the
distribution comparing LSAT scores with the bar exam attempts. More
people with a higher undergraduate GPA passed the bar exam on their
first try. And those who did not pass the bar consisted of people with a
lower GPA.

# [Conclusion]{.underline}

Overall, this study took a turn in focusing on demographic variables in
its EDA. Some conclusions that were drawn from this EDA was the lack of
racial diversity in law school students in 1991, with white students
being nearly 84% of the population in this study. For black and hispanic
law school students in this study, the majority were in the third family
income range (and also having the most students in the first family
income range).

Family income was another important venue of exploration in this study,
as law school generally is a big financial investment. Most of the
students in this study belonged in the second highest family income
range. There was no significant pattern between fulltime and parttime
students and their family income. Law school tiers, which was ranked
from 1-6 (based on clusters of undergraduate GPAs and LSAT scores) was
another good comparison with family income. The most students who
attended law schools ranked 6 were of the fifth family income range
while the most students who attended law schools ranked 1 were of the
first family income range.

Unsurprisingly, there were students who did not graduate law school
after entering in the fall of 1991. Of those that did not graduate, 89
students still tried for the bar exam (likely in states that allowed for
this pursuit) 65 passed the bar exam. LSAT scores and undergraduate GPAs
followed a similar trend with students attempting the bar, as those with
higher undergraduate GPAs and LSAT scores were the majority of the group
of students who bassed the bar exam on their first try. As the scores
and GPA's got smaller, the students were more likely to pass on the
second attempt or not at all.

For future studies, comparisons between recent studies on law students
today and this study would be beneficial to understand the changes. This
should also include creating a concrete method of converting the raw
LSAT score range used in 1991 to the ranges today, somehow accounting
for the changes in test difficulty as well. After some extensive
research, many argued their was little worth in trying to convert the
values. Another variable to research for might be personal income, as
many might not be financially supported by their families and might even
be taking out loans for their law school education.
